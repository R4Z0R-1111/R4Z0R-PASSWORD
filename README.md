# R4Z0R-PASSWORD
## A Simple Password Manager, to help you keep track of all your Accounts/Emails/Passwords!

![Alt text] (https://i.ibb.co/zx5df0h/r4z0rpasswordscreenshot.png)

I created this simple tool for people to keep their passwords, inside a little program! 
It can do several simple things:

- Add Passwords to the Manager
- Delete Passwords from the Manager
- Copy Passwords from the Manager
- Get Passwords from the Manager
- More Features are coming soon...

> Important Note: The tool is saving the passwords into the Manager.txt File! They are not encrypted! So I recommend using my R4Z0R-CRYPT Tool, to Encrypt the Text File after using the Password Manager and to Decrypt the Text File before using the Password Manager again!

You can find the R4Z0R-CRYPT Tool here: https://github.com/R4Z0R-1111/R4Z0R-CRYPT

If there are any suggestions message me here, or contact me on Discord! I am fairly new to programming in C# and these are one of my first projects! They are not the best! And not in there Final Version either!
